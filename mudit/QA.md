**Ques 1. How git workflow works?** 

*Git workflow is basically helps the user to understand git effectively. Git workflow basically contains the following steps:-*
*1. Creating branch(by default master) where your files will be commited.*
*2. Ofc creating files and working on it, at the end commiting the file.*
*3. Merge your other branch if you have created any with master if your newly created branch worked perfectly or else modify.
The files will be stored in local and remote repo so that we can access our project anytime.*


**Ques 2. What are the different stages of a git project as commit, add?** 

*1.Modified: we can modify the files or projects in the local repo without disturbing the original project.*
*2.staged:Staging area is the place where files are ready to be added in local repo.*
*3.commit: it is basically saving the file in the repo but each time you commit, the id or hash of the file or project will change thus making you available with the history of your project.*


**Ques 3. Is it possible to do a git commit before git add. If you have made any changes? Explain why?**

*No it's not possible as a file must be added and then must be committed which will give a hash(unique ID) to the file and if u made changes then again a new hash will be generated.*


**Ques 4. Why is git diff used?** 

*It is used to track the difference between the changes made on a project.*

**Ques1: What is meant by the term fork and clone?**

*Ans: Fork: it is basically the copy of the repo i.e. you can do the experiments or modifications in the project without harming the actual one. though we can pull the change in the orig repo by pulling it.Clone: cloning the repo is basically making copy of remote repo in the form of local repo.* 

**Ques 2: What are branches in Github?**

*Ans: Branch is basically a part or version of repo. a single repo can have multiple branches and multiple branches can be merged into one as well.by defeault : Master branch.e.g. if we are working on project under master branch and suddenly we create another branch names X and continue the project, we can go back to that instance where we created branch Xi.e. working on branch will not affect other branches thus helping in creating and accessing the different versions of the projects.* 

**Ques 3. What is PR?**

*Ans: PR: PULL REQUEST. It let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.* 

**Ques 4. Can we delete the master branch if not Why?**

*Ans: NO we cant delete Master branch as soon as we use command " git init", Master branch gets activated by default.* 

**Ques 5. How can we delete a branch?**

*Ans: use command : git branch -d <name of the branch*
